# Plotly_Deployment
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic webpage that includes bacterial data and the demographic information for each volunteer. 

For this analysis was created three charts: a bar chart with the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button, a bubble chart that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge that indictes the number of times a volunteer washes their belly button. This information can be searched for different volunteers by choosing a different Test Subject ID on the dropdown.
The webpage can be viewed here: [https://carolineshipley.github.io/Plotly_Deployment/](https://carolineshipley.github.io/Plotly_Deployment/)
